## HOWTO

* `npm i` to install all local dependencies
  * `webpack`, `webpack-dev-server`, `karma-cli` must be installed globally
* `npm test` to run unit tests
* `npm run run_dev` to start a dev env
* `npm run build_production` to build a production ready package

Note that you may need to install a advanced Node.js versionï¼Œ `5.6.0` is used in my local machine.

`nvm` is recommended to install Node.js. (https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
